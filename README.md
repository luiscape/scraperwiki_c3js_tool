Usage
-----
Create a `code your own tool` tool in ScraperWiki. Then clone this repository directly within that tool. You can use `swbox` to make the process easier. You have then to point the C3.js visualization to the data you want to visualize, either using the R helper file or by pointing the JavaScript snippet to the SQL endpoint of your data.
